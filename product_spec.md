# Product Specification for “Delphi Deeper”

## 1. Overview

“Delphi Deeper” is a virtual pet simulation game where players raise and train AI-powered pets (Peps) using neural networks. The pets evolve based on the player’s actions, with different traits emerging from training and gameplay. The game features a persistent online world where pets continue to live, train, and interact even when players are offline. Key gameplay elements include pet training, exploration, combat, and social dynamics, with an option for multiplayer interactions.

## 2. Core Features

	•	Pet Evolution System: Pets develop unique behaviors based on player actions, using a neural network to learn from manual training.
	•	Traits and Specialization: Traits like combat skill, utility proficiency, and social aptitude evolve based on gameplay, influencing the pet’s behavior and abilities.
	•	Time Chamber Training: An offline training mode where pets continue learning based on collected gameplay data, fine-tuning their skills and traits.
	•	Persistent Multiplayer World: A background simulation where pets live, interact, and evolve in a shared world. Features guilds, battles, resource gathering, and trading.
	•	Dynamic AI Training: Uses reinforcement learning and supervised learning techniques to evolve pet behaviors over time.

## 3. Game Mechanics

	•	Manual Training: Players guide pets directly to complete tasks (e.g., combat, resource gathering), collecting data for AI training.
	•	Neural Network Training: Player data is used to train a neural network, allowing the pet to make decisions based on prior experiences.
	•	Traits and Skills Development: Pets gain or lose traits and skills depending on their training focus (e.g., aggressive combat skills or scavenging efficiency).
	•	Multiplayer Interactions: Pets participate in guild activities, battles, or social scenarios in the persistent world, evolving based on real-world outcomes.

## 4. Technical Requirements

	•	Platform: PC or mobile.
	•	Programming Language: Golang (for server-side simulation and neural network integration), with a frontend framework like Unity or Godot for graphics.
	•	Neural Network Framework: Consider integrating with a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (with Golang bindings).

# Implementation Guide

## 1. Phase 1: Core Systems Development

	1.	Set Up Version Control: Start with a Git repository to manage code versions.
	2.	Define Game Entities: Create a data structure for the pet entity (Pep) to include traits, skills, and behaviors.
	3.	Neural Network Integration:
	•	Implement a basic neural network architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Use simple inputs (e.g., combat decisions, movement directions) for initial training.
	•	Create a supervised learning module where training data can be fed from player inputs.
	4.	Gameplay Mechanics (Single Player):
	•	Implement manual control mechanisms for guiding the pet (basic movement, combat, gathering).
	•	Set up data collection to record player actions for training.
	5.	Basic Time Chamber Simulation:
	•	Develop the time chamber functionality to allow offline training based on collected data.
	•	Implement basic reinforcement learning to reward behaviors matching the player’s manual input.

## 2. Phase 2: Multiplayer and Persistent World

	1.	Networking and Multiplayer Foundation:
	•	Build the server infrastructure to support persistent multiplayer interactions.
	•	Design the background simulation for real-time pet activities.
	2.	Guilds, Social Interactions, and Battles:
	•	Implement multiplayer mechanics like guilds, battles, and resource sharing.
	•	Develop AI-driven social and combat behaviors using the neural network to handle scenarios autonomously.
	3.	Persistent World Mechanics:
	•	Create a system for pets to evolve and adapt based on outcomes in the multiplayer environment (using real-time data).
	•	Allow pets to continue “living” and training even when players are offline.

## 3. Phase 3: Advanced Features and Polishing

	1.	Advanced AI Training Modules:
	•	Develop more complex training scenarios and behaviors, with specialized training capsules.
	•	Introduce randomness or exploration parameters to encourage adaptive learning.
	2.	Economy and Trading System:
	•	Implement in-game trading, pet breeding, and a marketplace for items and resources.
	•	Develop balancing mechanisms to prevent overpowered pets or exploits.
	3.	User Interface and Experience:
	•	Refine the UI to display pet progress, traits, and training feedback.
	•	Create visual representations of the pet’s emotions or state (happiness, aggression, etc.).
	4.	Testing and Optimization:
	•	Conduct gameplay testing to fine-tune AI behaviors.
	•	Optimize server performance for persistent simulations.
